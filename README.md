# 🌐 My Blog Website

This is my final assignment project for building, organizing, and deploying a multipage website.  
The project demonstrates **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript**, responsive design, interactivity, and deployment using GitHub Pages.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose
The website is a simple **Blog Website** that showcases personal content and allows visitors to learn about me, view services, and send messages through a contact form.

---

## 📑 Pages
1. **Home** – Introduction and featured blog posts.  
2. **About** – Blogger’s profile and mission.  
3. **Services** – Services offered (e.g., content writing, tutorials).  
4. **Contact** – Contact form connected to Formspree (`maryannwaithera@gmail.com`).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** (Flexbox & media queries) for styling and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** for interactivity (navigation toggle, form validation, Formspree integration)  
- **Formspree** for email handling in the contact form
